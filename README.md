# Object-tracking-using-YOLOv8-and-DeepSort

- This project aims to detect moving objects in a video and keep track of them.
- YOLOv8 is used to detect and localize each object in each frame. 
- The DeepSort library from [nwojke](https://github.com/nwojke/deep_sort) is used and modified to fit with the project and Tensorflow 2.X.
